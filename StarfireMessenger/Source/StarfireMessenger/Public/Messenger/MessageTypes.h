/*
 *  - Statefulness: The system allows messages to "fire and forget", but also allows for them to maintain state and be cleared when needed
 *					This allows the system to provide an easy way to handle "join in progress" situations where a listener needs to know that an message has already occurred and to get
 *					access to the data & context that it was comprised of.
 *				- Only make messages "stateful" if you need them to be. Don't use the system as a crutch to solve all your edge case needs. Being "stateful" costs memory, and even
 *				  though everything is fairly efficient, it can eventually add up.
 *
 *  - Hierarchical: When listening for messages types, listeners will also receive messages of child types (only supported for C++ message types)
 *				In both C++ and Blueprint, there are alternate params that allow for determining the actual message type safely if that is needed
 *				- A macro (`SET_MESSAGE_TYPE_AS_ABSTRACT`) is provided to configure messages types that are meant to act as a parent type, can be listened for but should not be broadcast directly.
 *				- Parent types do not _have_ to be abstract, but the support is provided for the cases where it is desirable.
 *
 *	- Message Types come in two flavors based that statefulness: Stateful and Immediate
 *	- Message Types can specify a ContextType that
 *			a) defines whether or not the message requires a context to broadcast
 *			b) when a context is required, defines the type of object that will be used as a context when the message is broadcast
 *			c) when a context is required, provide a strong guarantee that the context is actually valid (ie listeners shouldn't have to null check the context under most circumstances)
 *
 *			- to specify a context type, in the Message structure you just add a line that looks like: "SET_CONTEXT_TYPE(XXXXXX)"
 *				- XXXXXX could be any UObject derived type
 *				- The "ContextType" is inherited through parent types, which allows you to declare this ContextType in a common base structure and not require repeats in each child type
 *				- The "ContextType" can also be re-declared in child types and it will update the type
 *					- When doing this, the best practice is that these re-declarations should be more narrow than the parent
 *						- If EventA has ContextType = APawn, it's reasonable for EventB (derived from EventA) to redeclare ContextType = ACharacter (since ACharacter derives from APawn)
 *							However EventB (probably) shouldn't redeclare ContextType = AAIController (since it's unrelated to APawn as a child)
 *				- The type being specified as the "ContextType" does need a full definition available, only having access to a forward declaration isn't sufficient
 *					- This shouldn't really be a huge issue since context related events are probably declared with the context or with other events that share a context type
 *						and where the listener for that message likely would have to/want to include that header anyway
